Further enhancements

* If a cocktail DB simulator is created then this would allow for negative testing and responses could be deserialized into error response models
* If the API becomes more complex then the scenario context mappings can be split down on a per-response basis (e.g. COCKTAIL_SEARCH_RESPONSE/ INGREDIENT_SEARCH_RESPONSE)
  rather than using the generic API_RESPONSE context.
